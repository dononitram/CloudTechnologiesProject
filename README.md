2. After that run the server:

```sh
python src/backend/main.py
```

3. Once the server is running open the frontend spreadsheet located in the src/frontend/excel directory (open source under development).

4. Place the training data in the training area (8C Cell onwards horizontally and vertically) in the following way.

```
Training Input
Expected Output
Training Input
Expected Output
...
```

5. Hit Train

6. Place your input in the prediction area (Rows 4 and 5 from the column 4 onwards).

7. Hit Predict

### Example: Teaching the Model Simple Addition

Witness the magic of AI by teaching the model to perform simple addition of two parameters. Remember, the relationship between inputs and outputs isn't strictly 2:1; it can be n:n where n ‚â• 1.
