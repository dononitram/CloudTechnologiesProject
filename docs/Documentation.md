## 2.3. Convention Constraints

| Constraint | Explanation |
| - | - |
| Clean Code | The code composing the application must prioritize clarity and cleanliness, facilitating comprehension and ease of maintenance in the long term. We adhere to camelCase for JavaScript and PascalCase for React, ensuring clear and descriptive names while steering clear of confusing prefixes. We need to adhere to the conventions of the programming languages weâ€™re using, including JavaScript , HTML and CSS. |
| Arc42 | The project utilizes [Arc42](https://arc42.org/) for documentation purposes. |
| Usability | The application must be user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate. The user experience should be seamless and engaging, with a focus on accessibility and adaptability. So, to achieve this, we should use tools like Google LightHouse to measure the performance of the application. |
